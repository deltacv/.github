We're working on projects that revolutionize the traditional way of working with computer vision at a long-term commitment to create a community around our free software.<br>

In 2020, we created EOCV-Sim, a simple tool for high schoolers competing in the FIRST Tech Challenge to aid with the development of their robotics computer vision platforms, which has been used by hundreds of teams since its inception, completely changing the way their vision prototyping was being done up to that point.<br>

Now, we're building a computer vision platform that aims to make prototyping, testing, and deployement faster and easier than ever before.<br>
